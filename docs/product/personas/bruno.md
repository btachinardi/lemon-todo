> **Primary persona for v2. All new modules are designed for Bruno.**

- **Age**: 32
- **Role**: Solo full-stack developer and product owner, managing multiple active projects simultaneously
- **Tech Comfort**: Expert (daily use of git, CLI tools, Claude Code, ngrok, Docker, CI/CD pipelines)
- **Pain Points**:
  - **Scattered project management** — repos, worktrees, deployments, and tasks live in different tools with no single view
  - **Fragmented communications** — important messages and decisions are lost across Gmail, WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, LinkedIn, and GitHub
  - **Disconnected people/company knowledge** — no central record of who he talked to, what was agreed, or relevant context per relationship
  - **Manual agent orchestration** — Claude Code sessions require manual setup, context-loading, task assignment, and monitoring with no tracking of cost or output
- **Goals**: One unified hub for all development activities — never miss a message, never lose project context, never repeat a conversation because he forgot the previous one, and delegate implementation to AI agents without losing oversight
- **Device**: Desktop primary (Windows 11, large monitor setup), rarely needs mobile for v2 features
- **Modules Used**: All — `tasks`, `projects`, `comms`, `people`, `agents`
- **Job to Be Done**: "When I'm managing multiple active projects with AI agents, I want a single command center so I never lose context switching between tools."
