This document will capture the v2 implementation plan, broken into checkpoints that mirror the v1 checkpoint structure (CP1–CP5).

v2 extends LemonDo with four new modules: Projects, Communications, People, and Agent Sessions. See [`../product/modules/`](../product/modules/) for the functional requirements of each module.
