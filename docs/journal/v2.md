This journal will capture the v2 development process: planning decisions, architectural choices, lessons learned, and release notes for all v2 checkpoints (CP6 onward).

For the v1 development history, see [v1.md](./v1.md).

## Starting Point

v2 begins from the stable v1.0.7 baseline. The v1 MVP is live at [lemondo.btas.dev](https://lemondo.btas.dev) with:

- 908 tests (406 backend + 406 frontend + 96 E2E)
- 5 bounded contexts: Tasks, Boards, Identity, Administration, Notifications
- 3 languages: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish
- Azure deployment with Terraform IaC, CI/CD, and custom domains

v2 extends the platform with four new modules: Projects, Communications, People, and Agent Sessions. See [`../product/modules/`](../product/modules/) for functional requirements.

## v2 Entries (TBD)

> Entries will be added here as v2 development progresses.
