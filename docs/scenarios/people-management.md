## Scenario S-PP-01: Meeting Preparation

> Before a call with a client, Bruno opens their profile. He sees they prefer async communication, use Slack for quick questions, and mentioned last month that they're migrating to AWS. He also sees they have a birthday next week. He sends a quick "happy birthday" message after the meeting.

## Scenario S-PP-02: Knowledge Capture

> During a conversation, a colleague mentions they're an expert in Kubernetes. Bruno opens their profile, adds a note: "Strong K8s experience, offered to help with our deployment". This knowledge is now searchable and visible next time Bruno needs K8s help.
